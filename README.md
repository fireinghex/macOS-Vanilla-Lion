# macOS-Vanilla-Lion
Stuck on OS X Lion? Using this repo, you can make Lion look modern and bring useful functionality to it!

**What is the idea behind Vanilla Lion and what does it bring?**

I am a single person working on the whole project. Vanilla Lion is here to make macOS 10.7.5 Lion a usable and normal OS in 2022.
This project includes many files and instructions on how to install useful applicatons into OS X Lion, and in the future is hoping to have a custom installer that will provide an even better expirience. 

**How does Vanilla Lion work?**

Inside this repo, there are many folders and files. Each one is labeled by it's category, which shows what it contains inside. Inside each folder is also a README, with necessary instructions and et cetera. 

**Using this repository, what can I make to my existing Lion installation?**

Using this repo, you can get software I have hunted around the world wide web, it's all here, neat and collected! You can also change the appearence of the OS, to a more "modern look".
